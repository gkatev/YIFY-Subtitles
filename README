YIFY Subtitles is a simple command line for downloading subtitles from yifysubtitles.com

Installation
	Windows
	
	You probably want to compile YifySub.java and either add a batch file to run the
	program to your PATH variable or incorporate an option to run it from the context
	menu of .mp4 files (most yify movies come in mp4 format). An example registry 
	file (mp4.reg) is provided.
	
	Linux
	
	make
	sudo make install
	
	* Run using 'yifysub'
	
	You also probably want to create an alias to run the program with a default language, 
	thus reducing the required parameters (eg. alias yifysub="yifysub -l English -m").
	As in windows, you could also incorporate it in the context menu of your file manager.


Usage: java -jar <jar_name: yifysub.jar> [-l <language>] [--debug] [--batch] -m <path>
Options:
	-m <path>		The path to the video file to download subtitles for
					Doesn't actually need to to exist (see the algorithm)
	-l <language>	Language of the subtitles. Defaults to English
	--debug			Displays some debugging information
	--no-output		Supresses all output. Does not apply to --debug output

	
The algorithm the program follows:
	The name of the video file is used to attempt and predict the title of the movie.
	This does not always succeed since the movie title may contain tokes not allowed in
	the name of the video file (eg. colons). 
	
	If the search for the movie turns up empty, the user is prompted to provide another 
	name for the movie. At this point, entering a '\2' char (CTRL + B in windows) will 
	start the browser on yifysubtitles.com/search.
	
	If instead multiple results match the search term, the user is also prompted to choose
	one amongst them. This only displays the results of the first page of the search page.
	
	When the movie to download subtitles from is found/determined, the program will look
	for subtitles of the specified language that have a positive rating.
	
	If subtitles are found, they will use the path and name of the video file to save the
	subtitles in the same directory and the same name(excluding the extension).
	
	* The name of the video file passed does not need to actually point to an existing
	  file. Its name is used to determine the title of the movie and its path is used 
	  to save the subtitles.
