YIFY Subtitles is a simple command line utility used to automatically download subtitles from yifysubtitles.com

Basic installation includes simply compiling the source code
Furthemore, one might find useful to integrate it into the context menu of .mp4 files(almost all yify movies come in mp4 format)
In windows this can be easily done in the registry. A simple example reg file (mp4.reg) is provided

Usage: java [-cp <classpath>] YifySub -m <path> [-l <language>] [--debug] [--batch]
Options:
	-m <path>		The path to the video file to download subtitles for
					Doesn't actually need to point to a valid file,
					since only its name and directory will be used
					The subtitles will be downloaded in the same directory
	-l <language>	Language of the subtitles. Defaults to English
	--debug			Displays some debugging information
	--no-output		Supresses all output. Does not apply to --debug output
	
The program works in the following stages:
	It uses the name and path of the video file to determine the name of the movie and how the subtitle will be saved
	It will try to extract the movie name from the file name when that is the format of the yify releases
	Then it will proceed to search for the movie in yifysubtitles.com
	If more that one result is found, the user is prompted to choose one amongst them
	If no result is found, the user may enter another movie name to search for.
	At this point also, if \2 is given (CTRL + B in windows) a browser page to yifysubtitles.com/serch will be opened
	Note that in yify releases that follow the standard format a reason for not finding the movie might be dots or colons in the movie name.
	When the exact movie to download subtitles for has been determined it will search for subtitles in the specified language. 
	It will neglect subtitles with negative rating. 
	If subtitles that fit the criteria are found(language, rating) they will be downloaded 
	and saved with the same name of the video file and in the same directory.
